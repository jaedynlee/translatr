# translatr

A simple Flutter application for translating English text to some other dialect, like "Yoda", "Pirate", or "Boston".

Since it's only a single view app, all widget/view code is in main.dart, and API calls are made from the TranslationService. The translations are retrieved from the free Fun Translations API.
